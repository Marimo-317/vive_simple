# AutoDev Spec Phase 1A: Requirements Specification

**Spec-Driven Development Phase 1A:** Detailed Requirements Analysis & Documentation

**Feature:** $ARGUMENTS

I'll create a comprehensive requirements specification document that defines all functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, business rules, and acceptance criteria.

## Requirements Analysis Objectives:

**Business Analysis & Requirements Engineering**
Launching business-analyst specialist to:
- Analyze feature description and business context
- Define detailed functional requirements with acceptance criteria
- Create comprehensive user stories for all user types
- Establish non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Define business rules, validation logic, and authorization requirements
- Identify integration needs and data requirements
- Document edge cases, error scenarios, and success criteria

## Requirements Document Structure:

### 1. **Functional Requirements**
- Core functionality breakdown with priorities
- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Feature interactions and workflows
- Input/output specifications

### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and privacy requirements
- Usability and accessibility standards
- Compatibility and integration requirements

### 3. **Business Rules & Logic**
- Data validation rules and constraints
- Business workflow and process rules
- Authorization and access control requirements
- Compliance and regulatory considerations

### 4. **Integration & Data Requirements**
- External system integration needs
- API and service requirements
- Data model and storage requirements
- Migration and data transformation needs

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Testing strategy and coverage requirements
- Success criteria and metrics
- Definition of done checklist
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Project Context Integration:

The requirements will be developed considering:
- **Project Steering:** Alignment with overall project vision and objectives
- **Existing Architecture:** Integration with current system design
- **Technical Constraints:** Platform and technology limitations
- **Business Constraints:** Budget, timeline, and resource considerations

## Output:

After requirements completion:
- `.claude/specs/requirements-[feature-name].md` will be created
- Comprehensive requirements specification ready for review
- Foundation for technical design and implementation planning

## Approval Gate:

Requirements must be reviewed and approved before proceeding to technical design:
- Use `/autodev-approve-spec requirements [approve|reject] [feedback]` to review
- Approved requirements will enable `/autodev-design` command
- Rejected requirements will be revised based on feedback

## Next Steps (After Requirements Approval):

- `/autodev-design` - Create technical design based on approved requirements
- `/autodev-tasks` - Generate implementation tasks (requires approved design)
- `/autodev-execute` - Begin implementation (requires all specs approved)

**üîç Starting Requirements Analysis...**

I'll create a detailed requirements specification that serves as the definitive source of truth for what needs to be built and how success will be measured.
