# AutoDev Spec Phase 1B: Technical Design Specification

**Spec-Driven Development Phase 1B:** Technical Architecture & Design Documentation

I'll create a comprehensive technical design specification based on the approved requirements document.

## Prerequisites:

- Requirements specification must be completed and approved
- Project steering document should exist (recommended)
- Feature requirements document: `.claude/specs/requirements-*.md`

## Technical Design Objectives:

**Architecture & System Design**
Launching backend-architect and frontend-developer specialists to:
- Design system architecture and component structure
- Define API endpoints with request/response schemas
- Design database schema, migrations, and indexing strategy
- Plan service layer architecture and business logic
- Design frontend components, state management, and user flows
- Plan security implementation and performance optimization
- Define integration patterns for external services
- Create comprehensive testing and deployment strategy

## Technical Design Document Structure:

### 1. **Architecture Overview**
- System architecture diagrams and data flow
- Component interaction and communication patterns
- Technology stack decisions and justifications
- Scalability and performance architecture

### 2. **Backend Design**
- RESTful API endpoint specifications
- Database schema with tables, relationships, and indexes
- Service layer design with business logic separation
- Authentication, authorization, and security implementation
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

### 3. **Frontend Design**
- Component hierarchy and reusable design patterns
- State management architecture and data flow
- User interface design and responsive layout
- Route structure and navigation patterns
- Integration with backend APIs and error handling

### 4. **Integration Design**
- External service integration patterns
- API specifications and data transformation
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Rate limiting and performance considerations

### 5. **Quality & Operations**
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting design
- Deployment architecture and CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks and optimization targets

## Design Principles Integration:

The technical design will follow:
- **Project Steering:** Architecture principles and technology decisions
- **Requirements Alignment:** Direct traceability to functional requirements
- **Existing Patterns:** Consistency with current codebase architecture
- **Best Practices:** Industry standards and security best practices

## Output:

After design completion:
- `.claude/specs/design-[feature-name].md` will be created
- Detailed technical specifications ready for implementation
- Complete implementation roadmap and task breakdown foundation

## Approval Gate:

Technical design must be reviewed and approved before proceeding to task breakdown:
- Use `/autodev-approve-spec design [approve|reject] [feedback]` to review
- Approved design will enable `/autodev-tasks` command
- Rejected design will be revised based on technical feedback

## Next Steps (After Design Approval):

- `/autodev-tasks` - Generate detailed implementation task breakdown
- `/autodev-execute` - Begin implementation phase (requires all specs approved)

**üèóÔ∏è Starting Technical Design...**

I'll create a comprehensive technical design that provides clear implementation guidance while maintaining architectural consistency and following engineering best practices.

**Note:** This command requires approved requirements. If no requirements document exists, please run `/autodev-requirements <feature>` first.
