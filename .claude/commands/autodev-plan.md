# AutoDev Phase 1: Planning & Requirements

**Phase 1:** 調査→計画→要件定義 (人間承認待ち)

I'll execute the planning phase using specialized sub-agents, then wait for your approval before proceeding to implementation.

## Phase 1 Steps (Auto-Executed):

**Step 2: 調査フェーズ (Research)**
Launching search-specialist to:
- Analyze existing codebase and patterns
- Identify dependencies and libraries needed
- Find integration points and constraints
- Research best practices and approaches
- Assess technical risks and challenges

**Step 3: 計画フェーズ (Planning)** 
Launching architect-reviewer to:
- Break down feature into manageable tasks

**Step 4: 要件定義フェーズ (Requirements)**
Launching business-analyst to:

## Phase 1 Completion:

After completing research, planning, and requirements definition, I will:

## Next Steps (After Your Approval):

Once you approve the planning results:
- Use `/autodev-execute` to start Phase 2 (Implementation)
- GitHub Issues will be automatically created for task tracking
- Implementation will proceed with specialized sub-agents

**⚠️ Important:** Phase 1 will pause for your approval before creating any GitHub Issues or starting implementation.
