# AutoDev Phase 0: Project Initialization

**Phase 0:** Project Setup & Steering Document Creation

**Project Description:** $ARGUMENTS

I'll create a comprehensive project steering document that will guide all subsequent development decisions and specifications.

## Phase 0 Objectives:

**Project Steering Creation**
Launching business-analyst and architect-reviewer to:
- Analyze project description and scope
- Define project vision and core objectives
- Establish technical direction and architecture principles
- Set quality standards and development approach
- Identify constraints, risks, and decision framework
- Create comprehensive steering document

## Steering Document Sections:

1. **Project Vision & Objectives**
   - Clear project vision statement
   - Primary goals and success metrics
   - Business justification and target users

2. **Technical Direction** 
   - Architecture principles and guidelines
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Quality standards and performance targets

3. **Development Approach**
   - Methodology and team structure
   - Timeline and milestone planning
   - Communication and collaboration approach

4. **Decision Framework**
   - Decision-making processes
   - Approval authorities and escalation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Output:

After Phase 0 completion:
- `.claude/specs/steering.md` will be created
- Project foundation will be established
- Ready to proceed with spec-driven development

## Next Steps (After Steering Document Creation):

Use the detailed specification commands:
- `/autodev-requirements <feature>` - Create detailed requirements specification
- `/autodev-design` - Create technical design specification  
- `/autodev-tasks` - Generate implementation task breakdown

Or use simplified planning:
- `/autodev-plan <feature>` - Traditional 3-in-1 planning approach

**ðŸš€ Starting Project Initialization...**

The steering document will establish the foundation for all subsequent feature development and ensure consistency across the entire project lifecycle.
